  "p1": "Settling Roots was created to help expats make Portugal feel like home. We understand how exciting — and sometimes overwhelming — moving to a new country can be. From navigating bureaucracy to finding the right schools, housing, and community, our mission is to guide you every step of the way.",
  "p2": "Olá! I am Portuguese born and raised and I know what it feels like to start fresh in a new place — I spent more than 10 years living abroad as an expat myself. During that time, I faced the challenges of adjusting to a new culture, learning the systems, and creating a sense of belonging for my family.",
  "p3": "That personal experience is what inspired me to create Settling Roots: to make the process easier, more reassuring, and more welcoming for others who are now taking the same journey.",
  "p4": "We believe that starting a new chapter in Portugal should be smooth and enjoyable. Settling Roots provides resources, practical advice, and personalized support tailored to your family's needs, so you can focus on building a fulfilling life here.",
