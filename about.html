    <section>
      <p data-i18n="p1">
        Settling Roots was created to help expats make Portugal feel like home.  
        We understand how exciting — and sometimes overwhelming — moving to a new country can be.  
        From navigating bureaucracy to finding the right schools, housing, and community, our mission is to guide you every step of the way.

      <h2 data-i18n="section1">My Story</h2>
      <p data-i18n="p2">
        Olá! My name is Nídia, I am Portuguese born and raised and I know what it feels like to start fresh in a new place —  
        I spent more than 10 years living abroad as an expat myself.  
        During that time, I faced the challenges of adjusting to a new culture, learning the systems,  
        and creating a sense of belonging for my family.
      </p>
      <p data-i18n="p3">
        That personal experience is what inspired me to create Settling Roots:  
        to make the process easier, more reassuring, and more welcoming for others who are now taking the same journey.
